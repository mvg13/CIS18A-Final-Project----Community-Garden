# Course-Project---Community-Garden

How to run the program:
Copy and paste code into notepad++  or an IDE. Save as CommunityGarden.Java    Compile code with javac CommunityGarden
Once program is running.
Start by registering. Choose option 1.
Then proceed through the menu choices.
*** Note a limitation of this program is that each user must go through the menu and decide if they want to schedule an appointment, volunteer, or donate before trying to register another user. Program will stop storing data under the current user once a new registration is entered. 
Option 5 is meant to display the community members information as well as their donations, appointment, or volunteer dates. 
Option 6 will write the data to a .txt file. 
Users can close the program with option 7.

Limitations: 
The program will need to incorporate security measures like passwords in the registration process in the future. Protecting the community members information is important. 

No GUI. Ideally, program would have a calendar that they could click to set their appointment. They would also be able to see the community member information on the calendar.
